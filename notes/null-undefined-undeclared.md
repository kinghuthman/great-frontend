# null vs undefined vs undedeclared

## meaning

null: value set by developer to declare variable has no value

undefined: variable has been declared but not assigned a value

undeclared: variable that has not been declared at all

## type

null: 'object'

undefined: 'undefined'

undeclared: 'undefined'

As a good habit, define variables with null rather than leaving them undefined or undeclared if we don't intend to use them yet.
